# 7Forks

Welcome to 7Forks, a stress management tracker.

###MVP
This app should allow users to create and update "forks", or visual representations of the cares and concerns in their lives.

Ideally, a unique setup will produce some of these forks for them, which can then be expanded upon by the user.

Each fork should provide outside resources for the healthy handling of these concerns.

###Existing App

The existing app uses Devise for user registration, thereby protecting users from external tampering.  I also used Heroku for hosting.

###Next Steps

I want to pursue user testing to determine what additional functionality would be useful.  I would like to add authorizations for adding and updating tools within each fork.  I would like to improve my styling for user readability and interest.
