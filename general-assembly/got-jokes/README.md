##Why did you choose this subject?
We were interested in alternate forms of data binding, and interacting with Mongo.
##How were you first made aware of it?
We Googled it.
##What problem does it solve?
Meteor serves as a unique meeting point for many of the libraries, frameworks, and other dev tools (think sockets) that we have discussed in the last week. It takes a few minutes to become comfortable seeing Angular, Mongoose, and old school class constructors appearing next to each other in the same app, but it allows us as developers to use whatever technologies we want, all at the same time.
##How does it solve the problem (conceptually)?
Meteor essentially plugs all the dev tools into each other. It serves as a virtual space to bridge the gap between a MEAN app and real-time data binding.
##Why does one use it?
It saves us from having to code around synchronicity, since it binds data two ways.
##What are the alternatives?
Socket.io comes to mind when looking for two-way data binding.
##What is it similar to, if anything?
There are a number of similar frameworks, including vue.js and backbone.  Meteor, unlike most, is a full-stack framework.
##What is the history of this technology?
New.
##Who built it and why?
Meteor was developed by the Meteor Development Group.  They are apparently excellent at naming things. They built it because they received $11.2M in funding from Andrees Horowitz in 2012.  It was designed specifically to save developers from having to write synchronization code.
##What is your opinion on the technology after having built something with it?
It seems that there is a lot of excitement around it. I'm not sure we got very deep into its capabilities, however, it can do cool things and warrants further exploration.
##What are the biggest conceptual hurdles (if any) you encountered when researching this?
It was a challenge to keep track of the myriad files and dev tools we were using in a concentrated app.
