In addition to being an expert programmer, you're now the Question Master of all things web-dev

Design a flashcard management application, used in the command line, in which you allow users to create, read, update, and delete flashcards.

## Gameplay

- When starting the application, prompt the user to:
  - Create a new flashcard
  - View all flashcards
  - Edit a flashcard
  - Delete a flashcard
  - View score / recent answers

## Requirements

- The player should be able to quit the command line and resume their game later.
- The player should be able to see their score and how many cards/questions they got right.
- Allow users to create lists or categories of flashcards.
- Allow users to view only the flashcards in one particular category or another.

## Bonus

- If the user does not get a question right, add that card back in to the mix and keep asking until they get it right.
- Record the number of attempts a user makes to answer a question.
