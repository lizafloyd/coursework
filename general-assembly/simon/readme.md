#Simon Project

##Overview
I built a repetition/memory game using a series of nested Javascript functions, linked to html and CSS pages.

##Approach Taken
I used a combination of vanilla js and jQuery to set up nested functions.  I used if loops, for loops, and timeout functions to push to arrays that represent the two arrays, one filled at random by js function, and the other by the user through a click event.

The takeaway lesson for me was in handling moments when I get blocked from making progress.  When I am stuck, I should look at the problem from another angle.  Either solve the issue another way, or change my syntax.  I am also growing more comfortable with troubleshooting, by going through the input from the program's point of view (if computer programs had povs).

##Still To Do
- Refactor code
- ~~Set up timeout if no guess is made~~
- ~~Fix link in input setup in lose.html (best practices)~~ (Nick tells me to disregard re: validation)
- ~~Fix timing on later levels~~
- ~~Instructions~~

##Bonus to Do
- Levels reward structure/Colors
- Challnge levels
- Leaderboard (?)

##User Stories
- As a user, I should have no trouble with visually following gameplay in order to win each round.
- As a player, I should be able to keep track of my level in order to beat previous attempts.
- As a future developer, I should be able to follow the logic of the existing code (this encourages me to pursue my goal of refactoring some, since my code as it exists is a little bloated.)
- As a player, I should have time to submit my guess, but not so much time as to be prohibitive to game play.
- As a player, my status in the game should be clear, as should instructions for play.  This allows me to participate.
