###MVP
As a user, I should be able to get trip inspiration in the form of photos, recommendations, and stories from other users of the app, filterable by location/country.  
As a user traveling alone, I should be able to save trip plans, star recommendations and destinations, track expenses, and attach notes to hopeful destinations.  
As a user traveling with a group, I will be able to update any details relating to my trip, and these changes will be reflected in the trip information of my fellow travelers.  
As a user, I should be able and encouraged to add photos, stories, and recommendations to the list of recommendations for other users to see.  
###Bronze
As a user, I should be able to visualize others' recommendations on a map of the globe, rather than in filterable list form.  
As a user, I should be able to export all of my trip data as a pdf or similar for use offline while traveling.  
###Silver
As a user, I will be able to locate and contact open users local to my future trips, for advice or social interaction.
